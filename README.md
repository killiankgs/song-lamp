Code for turning this mp3 file of a clip of the Bjork song, "All Is Full of Love," into a waveform radial. Can be used with any mp3. 
Code will save drawing as an SVG file upon mouse click.
Also included is the SVG file of the radial I saved to use to make a lamp from acrylic sheets with a laser cutter.
Illustrator files included for loading into the laser cutter software. Measurements are specific to Ikea bulb and cord set.
One Illustrator file is for the base and has a cutout for feeding the cord amongst the bottom layers in the final laser cut lamp.
The other Illustrator file has the cutouts for the Ikea lamp base and bulb, as well as the closed radial for the top layers of the finished lamp. 
Visibility of file layers can be toggled for each.
